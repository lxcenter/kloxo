XCACHE and XDEBUG
-----------------

If you wish to enable *both* XCache and Xdebug whilst running the Loader, please
use XCache as an ordinary extension rather than a Zend engine extension. That
is, install XCache using the following line in the ini file and with xcache.so
in the extensions directory:  

extension = xcache.so

If you are only running XCache then it can be installed as a Zend engine 
extension when the Loader is also installed.
