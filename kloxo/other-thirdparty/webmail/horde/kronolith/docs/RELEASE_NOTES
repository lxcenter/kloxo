The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H3 (2.3.6).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application.  It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server.  Supported features include shared
calendars, remote calendars, meeting management, alarms, recurring events, and
a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping
events.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H3 (2.3.5) are:
    * Added support for new Share SQL driver in Horde 3.3.12.
    * Minor improvements.
    * Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, French, Hungarian, and Spanish
      translations.
