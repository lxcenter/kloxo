The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Nag Task List
Manager version H3 (2.3.7).

lists).  It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and offers shared task lists.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H3 (2.3.6) are:
    * Added support for new Share SQL driver in Horde 3.3.12.
    * Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, French, Hungarian, and Spanish
      translations.
